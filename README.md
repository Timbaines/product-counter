A React application that counts products using dummy data using faker.js dependency.  The UI component displays a counter with increment and decrement buttons including a list of products.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Imports
- `React`: The core library for building user interfaces. - `ReactDOM`: Specifically for rendering components to the DOM. - `faker`: A library for generating fake data. Here itâ€™s used to create a fake MongoDB ObjectID for a new product. - `Product`: A React component that likely represents a single product item (imported from a local file). - `productsData`: An array of product data (imported from a local data file).


### 2. App Component
- This declares a functional component named `App` and defaults exports it, making it accessible to other parts of the application.
   

### 3. State Hook
- A state variable `count` is initialized with `0`, and `setCount` is the function to update this state.


### 4. Event Handlers
- increment`: Increases the count state by 1. - `decrement`: Decreases the count state by 1.
   

### 5. Product List Modification
- `productsCopy`: A shallow copy of the `productsData` array. - A new product with a simulated MongoDB ObjectID and a default name `"+ Create new item"` is added to `productsCopy`.


### 6. Render Method
- Displays the current count value. - Two buttons that call `increment` and `decrement` functions to modify the count. - A `div` containing a list of `Product` components, generated by mapping through `productsCopy`. Each `Product` component gets a unique `key` and `product` prop.
   

7. Root Render
- Initializes the React app by creating a root rendering container. - Renders the `App` component wrapped in `React.StrictMode` (which helps with identifying potential problems in the application) to the DOM element with the ID `root`.
